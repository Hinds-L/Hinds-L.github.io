<br>
<br>
1 I have successfully learned 2 different types of camera systems for 1 company. Got through a 40 hour work week with appointments scheduled every 10 mins. Successfully changed camera film in pitch dark.
2 Passed a 300 question pharmacy technician certification test on the 1st try.
3. Worked fulltime 5-6 days a week and went to school fulltime, 5 days a week.
<br>
<br>
1. I am hard on myself but, It encourages me to think about the steps needed to take to avoid mishaps again.
2. When i start something, I am dedicated into to seeing it through.
3. I am passionate about many things. I dont limit myself. At times I might seem unsure but, I am just thinking of what to do next.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. It really depends on the activity. In pharmacy, the passion to help the patients that need their medications. To help them feel better. There was no ability to be creative. Using logic is mainly using math to figure out medication quantities and refills.
In activities that i can be creative in, I am able to choose the platform. Like with sewing, cutting fabric doesnt have to be done on the table. I can do it on the floor. I am able to choose the fabrics, threads, and tools that i want to use.
